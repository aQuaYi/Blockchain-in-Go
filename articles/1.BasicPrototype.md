## Introduction 简介

Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century, which is still maturing and which potential is not fully realized yet. In its essence, blockchain is just a distributed database of records. But what makes it unique is that it’s not a private database, but a public one, i.e. everyone who uses it has a full or partial copy of it. And a new record can be added only with a consent of other keepers of the database. Also, it’s blockchain that made cryptocurrencies and smart contracts possible.

区块链是 21 世纪最具革命性的科技之一，他依然在高速发展阶段，没有释放其全部潜力。本质上，区块链是分布式数据库中的一种。而其与众不同的特性是，他不是一个私有数据库，而是公开的，例如，每个用户都拥有完整或部分的数据备份。与此同时，只有在其他数据库用户同意的前提下，才能往数据库中添加数据。最后，区块链使得加密货币和智能合约成为可能。

In this series of articles we’ll build a simplified cryptocurrency that’s based on a simple blockchain implementation.

在本系列文章中，我们会在一条简化后的区块链上，构建一个简单的加密货币。

## Block 区块

Let’s start with the “block” part of “blockchain”. In blockchain it’s blocks that store valuable information. For example, bitcoin blocks store transactions, the essence of any cryptocurrency. Besides this, a block contains some technical information, like its version, current timestamp and the hash of the previous block.

让我们从“区块链”的“区块”开始。区块用于存在有价值的信息。例如，比特币区块中保存了交易信息，这是所有加密货币的基本功能。此外，区块中储存了一些继续信息，比如区块链的版本号，区块生成的时间戳和前一个区块的 hash 地址。

In this article we’re not going to implement the block as it’s described in blockchain or Bitcoin specifications, instead we’ll use a simplified version of it, which contains only significant information. Here’s what it looks like:

在本文中，我们不准备去构建区块链或比特币所需的那种区块，我们会以一种简化版的区块取而代之。这种简化的区块只会包含最重要的信息，他们长下面这样：

```go
type Block struct {
    Timestamp     int64
    Data          []byte
    PrevBlockHash []byte
    Hash          []byte
}
```

`Timestamp` is the current timestamp (when the block is created), `Data` is the actual valuable information containing in the block, `PrevBlockHash` stores the hash of the previous block, and `Hash` is the hash of the block. In Bitcoint specification `Timestamp`, PrevBlockHash, and Hash are block headers, which form a separate data structure, and transactions (Data in our case) is a separate data structure. So we’re mixing them here for simplicity.

`Timestamp` 记录了创建区块的时间。`Data`包含了区块中真正重要的信息。`PrevBlockHash` 记录了上一个区块的 hash 地址。`Hash` 是这个区块的 hash 值。


So how do we calculate the hashes? The way hashes are calculates is very important feature of blockchain, and it’s this feature that makes blockchain secure. The thing is that calculating a hash is a computationally difficult operation, it takes some time even on fast computers (that’s why people buy powerful GPUs to mine Bitcoin). This is an intentional architectural design, which makes adding new blocks difficult, thus preventing their modification after they’re added. We’ll discuss and implement this mechanism in a future article.

For now, we’ll just take block fields, concatenate them, and calculate a SHA-256 hash on the concatenated combination. Let’s do this in SetHash method:

```go
func (b *Block) SetHash() {
    timestamp := []byte(strconv.FormatInt(b.Timestamp, 10))
    headers := bytes.Join([][]byte{b.PrevBlockHash, b.Data, timestamp}, []byte{})
    hash := sha256.Sum256(headers)

    b.Hash = hash[:]
}
```

Next, following a Golang convention, we’ll implement a function that’ll simplify the creation of a block:

```go
func NewBlock(data string, prevBlockHash []byte) *Block {
    block := &Block{time.Now().Unix(), []byte(data), prevBlockHash, []byte{}}
    block.SetHash()
    return block
}
```

And that’s it for the block!

## Blockchain

Now let’s implement a blockchain. In its essence blockchain is just a database with certain structure: it’s an ordered, back-linked list. Which means that blocks are stored in the insertion order and that each block is linked to the previous one. This structure allows to quickly get the latest block in a chain and to (efficiently) get a block by its hash.

In Golang this structure can be implemented by using an array and a map: the array would keep ordered hashes (arrays are ordered in Go), and the map would keep hash → block pairs (maps are unordered). But for our blockchain prototype we’ll just use an array, because we don’t need to get blocks by their hash for now.

```go
type Blockchain struct {
    blocks []*Block
}
```

This is our first blockchain! I’ve never thought it would be so easy 😉

Now let’s make it possible to add blocks to it:

```go
func (bc *Blockchain) AddBlock(data string) {
    prevBlock := bc.blocks[len(bc.blocks)-1]
    newBlock := NewBlock(data, prevBlock.Hash)
    bc.blocks = append(bc.blocks, newBlock)
}
```

That’s it! Or not?..

To add a new block we need an existing block, but there’re not blocks in our blockchain! So, in any blockchain, there must be at least one block, and such block, the first in the chain, is called genesis block. Let’s implement a method that creates such a block:

```go
func NewGenesisBlock() *Block {
    return NewBlock("Genesis Block", []byte{})
}
```

Now, we can implement a function that creates a blockchain with the genesis block:

```go
func NewBlockchain() *Blockchain {
    return &Blockchain{[]*Block{NewGenesisBlock()}}
}
```

Let’s check that the blockchain works correctly:

```go
func main() {
    bc := NewBlockchain()

    bc.AddBlock("Send 1 BTC to Ivan")
    bc.AddBlock("Send 2 more BTC to Ivan")

    for _, block := range bc.blocks {
        fmt.Printf("Prev. hash: %x\n", block.PrevBlockHash)
        fmt.Printf("Data: %s\n", block.Data)
        fmt.Printf("Hash: %x\n", block.Hash)
        fmt.Println()
    }
}
```

Output:

```text
Prev. hash:
Data: Genesis Block
Hash: aff955a50dc6cd2abfe81b8849eab15f99ed1dc333d38487024223b5fe0f1168

Prev. hash: aff955a50dc6cd2abfe81b8849eab15f99ed1dc333d38487024223b5fe0f1168
Data: Send 1 BTC to Ivan
Hash: d75ce22a840abb9b4e8fc3b60767c4ba3f46a0432d3ea15b71aef9fde6a314e1

Prev. hash: d75ce22a840abb9b4e8fc3b60767c4ba3f46a0432d3ea15b71aef9fde6a314e1
Data: Send 2 more BTC to Ivan
Hash: 561237522bb7fcfbccbc6fe0e98bbbde7427ffe01c6fb223f7562288ca2295d1
```

That’s it!

## Conclusion

We built a very simple blockchain prototype: it’s just an array of blocks, with each block having a connection to the previous one. The actual blockchain is much more complex though. In our blockchain adding new blocks is easy and fast, but in real blockchain adding new blocks requires some work: one has to perform some heavy computations before getting a permission to add block (this mechanism is called Proof-of-Work). Also, blockchain is a distributed database that has no single decision maker. Thus, a new block must be confirmed and approved by other participants of the network (this mechanism is called consensus). And there’re no transactions in our blockchain yet!

In future articles we’ll cover each of these features.
